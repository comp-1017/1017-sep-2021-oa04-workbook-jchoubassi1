                <h2> Choosing the Best Apples for pies</h2>
                <p>So what is the best apple for apple pie? Well this question can start a fight in any kitchen. SO you want a tart and tangy apple witha firm flesh. Maybe you like a splash of sweetness or maybe a firm fleshy apple is more to your liking. When it comes to choosing your apple for Grandma's apple pie we recommen using Granny Smith, Honeycrisp, or Mutsu</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Granny Smith</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Grany SMith apples are generally thought of as the go-to baking apple, but in the BA test kitchen, we have a few favs that hold up under heat and balance sweet-tart flavour. Try them when you're ready to branch out.
                    </dd>

                    <dt> Honeycrisp</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Honeycrisp is our desert-island apple <a href="#apple">(choosing apples)</a>". It's shatteringly crisp texture is guaranteed to hold firm when baked or caramelized, such as in our Apple-Molasses Upside-down cake or an elegant Tarte tatin.
                    </dd>

                    <dt id= "apple"> Mutsu</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Mutsu also known as crispin, this firm-fleshed, less tart option is similar in flavour to a Golden Delicious. Great for pies or other recipes that call for gentle cooking.
